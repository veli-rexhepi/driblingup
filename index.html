                <p>The first official match on the territory of Macedonia was played on August 27, 1933. On January 22, 1950, in Kumanovo, the Basketball Union of Macedonia became independent of the founding Assembly. Club activities culminated in the first national team being trusted to organize the Men's World Cup (Group C) in 1970. On December 21, 1991, the Basketball Union of Macedonia requested from the Congress in Springfield admission with full membership in FIBA. The request received verification on April 30, 1993, at the FIBA Executive Committee meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The decision was confirmed at the annual FIBA European Conference in Oslo, Norway on 22 May 1993.</p>
                <p>Today, the Macedonian Basketball Federation counts 85 members (registered clubs) with 3,500 registered basketball players in all categories, senior or youth. The first official matches of the Macedonian senior national team were recorded at the qualifiers for the continental championship (1993) in Wroclaw, Poland in the period from May 30 to June 1. Since then, the writing of a new page in the history of basketball in the independent Republic of Macedonia begins.</p>
